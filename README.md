# FlowSwing-Max-MSP
FlowSwing is a Max/MSP package for real-time rhythmic manipulation based on Non-Isochronous (NI) Grids. It provides tools for time-warping audio and modulating control signals using flexible timing structures defined by a small set of parameters. Warp markers and breakpoints can be aligned to NI Grids and adjusted during performance. All parameters are mappable and fully integrable into Max projects.
